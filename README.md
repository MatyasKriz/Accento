# Acčento
##### [Ak·čento]

---

Acčento is an easy-to-use tool for adding Czech diacritics to copied text. The app lives in the menu bar and is activated using a global hot key.

The app also contains preferences allowing you to customize the hot key as well as other quality of life features.

Props to [<img style="height: 24px" src="./img/Lingea-logo.png">](https://www.nechybujte.cz/nastroje) for providing the incredible diacritics service.

## Installation
Visit [Releases](https://github.com/MatyasKriz/Accento/releases) and download a `.zip` file of the latest version, open it, move the app into the `Applications` folder and launch it.
